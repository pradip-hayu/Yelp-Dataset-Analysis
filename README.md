# Yelp-Dataset-Analysis

Yelp is a social networking site/app, centered on customer reviews of local businesses. Anyone can post a review on Yelp, and anyone searching the web can use Yelp to find and evaluate local businesses. With more and more people being introduced to this app, it also provides Yelp a huge amount of market information, which could be used for local businesses to improve their performance based on ratings and reviews and local government to identify the most thriving business type in town. It is highly likely that this is one of the reasons that Yelp host this big data challenge for the public to analyze from different perspectives.
